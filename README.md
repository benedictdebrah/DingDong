# DingDong

This repo is part of my journey to revise and refresh my knowledge of Golang. I started learning this language earlier this year but never used it actively, resulting in me being rusty with it. so wrote this to help me revisit and understand some of the core concepts of Golang.

## Topics Covered
At the end of this session, I was able to cover and understand the following concepts:

1. **Variables and Constants**
2. **Data Types**
3. **Getting User Inputs**
4. **Pointers**
5. **Arrays and Slices**
6. **Loops**
7. **Conditionals**
8. **Switch Statements**
9. **Maps**
10. **Structs**
11. **Organizing Code**
12. **Logic**
13. **Encapsulating Logic with Functions**
14. **Goroutines**
